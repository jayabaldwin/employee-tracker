  <h1 align="center">SQL: Employee Tracker</h1>

  ## Description
  The purpose of this application was to create an interface that allows non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. I have built a command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
